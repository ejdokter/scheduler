# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application to book and manage appointments between students and interviewers. A student can visit this application to book appointments between 12pm and 5pm. When a student has chosen a vacant time slot they can click the round plus sign button to begin. The student will fill out their name, select which interviewer they would like, and press save when finished. If they would like to delete or edit their interview, they can do so easily with the edit and delete buttons.
